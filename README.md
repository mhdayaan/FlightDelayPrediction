## Introduction

Flight Delay Prediction is a project that leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict whether a flight will be delayed. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of predictive models using libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mhdayaan/FlightDelayPrediction/
cd FlightDelayPrediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the dataset for modeling, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

2. **Model Training**: Train various machine learning models, including Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and deep learning models like LSTM.

3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, mean squared error, and mean absolute error.

4. **Prediction**: Use the trained models to predict flight delays on new data.

## Libraries Used

The following libraries were used in this project:

- **numpy**: Numerical computing.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **seaborn**: Statistical data visualization.
- **scipy**: Scientific computing and technical computing.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning models and tools.
- **tensorflow**: Deep learning framework.
- **feature-engine**: Feature engineering for machine learning.

## Data

The dataset used for this project contains historical flight data, including information such as departure and arrival times, flight duration, and other relevant features. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

## Modeling

Several models were developed and evaluated, including:

- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Networks**

Each model was trained and evaluated to determine its effectiveness in predicting flight delays.

## Results

The models were evaluated using various metrics, including:

- **Accuracy**
